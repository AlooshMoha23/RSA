# bignum2023



## Concise Evaluation of the Program
The program has been subjected to rigorous testing to ensure its robustness, accuracy, and scalability. It has been tested with keys up to 1024 bits. Although it can generate larger keys, itâ€™s important to note that this process can be time-consuming. For instance, generating a 1024-bit key takes approximately 20 minutes.

## how to test the program
Testing the program is straightforward. compile the Bignum.cpp file using " g++  Bignum.cpp " then simply run the binary file of the program in the terminal. Upon execution, the program will display a predefined example with a 20-bit key. The user is then prompted to enter the message they wish to encrypt, as well as the size of the key. The entered message will be encrypted and subsequently decrypted to demonstrate the effective operation of the RSA program.
